# Where the SHP fork touches upstream files

Everything SHP-specific lives in new files. These are the only lines added to
files Kooka Pictura upstream also changes; check them first after
`git merge upstream/master`.

| Upstream file | Hook |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.toml` | `crates/pictura-shp` in `[workspace] members`; its `[profile.test.package.pictura-shp]` opt-level |
| `Cargo.lock` | the `pictura-shp` path package |
| `NOTICE.md` | the ported-code paragraph for `crates/pictura-shp` |
